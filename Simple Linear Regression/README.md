# Simple Linear Regression

The dataset contains two columns containing Years Experience and Salary. There are 30 observations in the dataset. We need to find out the co-relation between salaries and years of experience.

â€‹			You can get the dataset [here]()

 

> **Dependent Variable**
>
> The y is dependent variable which changes . 
> For example y is the salary how does it changes with the years of experience or y is the hours of study depending on the grade of student.

> **Independent Variable**
>
> The x is independent variable. A direct or indirect factor to change the dependent variable.

> The variable b1 is a multiplier for the independent variable and b0 is the constant term



##### Let us take the dataset and draw a graph to understand it better.



When experience is zero the constant b1 turns out to be zero . So Salary = b0. So as the slope line increase salary increase as observed from the graph.

#### How to get the best line which fits the data better ?

We will use the same graph . But here we will draw vertical lines from the actual observation to the slope line. 



The red cross indicates the person salary should be according to his years of experience. But the green line shows the person salary according to slop line. The green line is the difference between the observed and modelled earning. 
So to get the best fitting line. 

We draw all possible lines and the line in which we get the minimum is the best line which fits the data.
